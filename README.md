# Musical Universes of Discourse

MUD is a layer over Overtone to make live composition more power and immediate.

MUD focuses on immediacy of expression and creation.

Overtone is extremely powerful at the cost of verbosity. Live coding requires quite a lot of code.
Snippet expansion can help alleviate but it does hinder the range of expression and clutters the visual
experience for the audience reading along with the code.

## Install

```clojure
[mud "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]
```

## Usage

### Chords

Use a single synth/inst def to play chords.

```clojure
(def singing-chord-g
  (chord-synth general-purpose-assembly 3 :amp 0.0 :noise-level 0.05 :beat-trg-bus (:beat time/beat-1th) :beat-bus (:count time/beat-1th) :attack 0.1 :release 0.1))
  
(:bufs singing-chord-g) ;; Access all the bufs of a chord.
(:synths singing-chord-g) ;; Access all the running synths of a chord.

(chord-pattern singing-chord-g [[:C3 :E3 :F3]]

(doseq [synth (:synths singing-chord-g)] (ctl synth :amp 0.2))
```

### Patterns

```clojure
(use 'mud.core)

(defonce notes-buf (buffer 128))

;;Write a pattern immediately. Supports automatic conversion of degrees or notes.
(pat notes-buf [5 3 7] :minor :F3) ;; Degrees
(pat notes-buf [:A5 :A3 :A7])      ;; Notes
(pat notes-buf [300 400 600])      ;; Frequencies
(pat [notes1-buf notes2-buf notes3-buf] [5 3 7] :minor :F3) ;; Chords


;;Write a pattern on a beat one time (based on main-beat by default)
(pat-at 8 notes-buf [5 3 7] :minor :F3)

;;Keep writing a pattern every nth beat.
(pat-repeat 8 notes-buf #(degrees (shuffle [5 3 7]) :minor :F3))

;;Create a sequencer which specifies samples as well as on/offs
(defonce drums (seqer [kick-s _ kick-s _ snare-s [kick-s snare-s]]))
```

## Goals

* Its centered around using Supercollider for timing rather than Java.
* Buffers are the default way to express patterns.
* Keep it Clojure, support Clojures fns to manipulate patterns.
